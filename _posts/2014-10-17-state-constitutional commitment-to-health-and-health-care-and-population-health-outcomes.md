Objectives:
I investigated whether the introduction of health and health care provisions in US state constitutions can <strong>make health systems more equitable and improve health outcomes by urging state policymakers and administrative agencies to uphold their human rights obligations at state level</strong>.

Methods:
I constructed a panel of infant mortality rates from 50 US states over the period 1929 through 2000 to examine their association with the timing and details of introducing a constitutional right to health and health care provisions.

Results:
<strong>The introduction of a stronger constitutional commitment that obligates state legislature to provide health care was associated with a subsequent reduction in the infant mortality rate of approximately 7.8%</strong>. <strong>The introduction of provisions explicitly targeting the poor was also associated with a reduction in the infant mortality rate of 6.5%</strong>. These health benefits are primarily evident in non-White populations.

Conclusions:
This empirical result supports Elizabeth Leonard’s view that <strong>although state constitutional rights have been poorly enforced through the judiciary, a constitutional expression of health care duties has fueled the political and social process, ultimately allowing states to identify the best way to address citizens’ health inequality concerns</strong>.
