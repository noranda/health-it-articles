Background:
Tobacco use remains the number one cause of preventable chronic disease and death in developed countries worldwide. In Canada, smoking rates are highest among young adults. <strong>Despite that the majority of young adult smokers indicate wanting to quit, smoking rates among this age demographic have yet to decline</strong>. Helping young adults quit smoking continues to be a public health priority. <strong>Digital mobile technologies present a promising media for reaching this population with smoking cessation interventions</strong>, especially because young adults are the heaviest users of this technology.

Objective:
The primary aim of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of an evidence-informed smartphone app for smoking cessation, CrushtheCrave®, on reducing smoking prevalence among young adult smokers.

Methods:
A parallel randomized controlled trial with two arms will be conducted in Canada to evaluate CrushtheCrave®. In total, 1354 young adult smokers (19 to 29) will be randomized to receive the evidence-informed smartphone app, CrushtheCrave® , or an evidence-based self-help guide known as “On the Road to Quitting” (control) for a period of six months. The primary outcome measure is 30-day point prevalence of abstinence at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include 7-day point prevalence of abstinence, number of quit attempts, reduction in consumption of cigarettes, self-efficacy, satisfaction, app utilization metrics, and use of smoking cessation services. A cost-effectiveness analysis from a government perspective using a Markov model is included. To obtain a more in-depth understanding of the potential barriers and facilitators to uptake of CrushtheCrave®, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of participants in the intervention group.

Results:
This randomized controlled trial will provide the evidence to move forward on decision-making regarding the inclusion of technology-based smartphone interventions as part of existing smoking cessation efforts made by healthcare providers, inform the development of future apps, provide a deeper understanding of the factors that drive change in smoking behaviour using an app, and improve the design of cessation apps.

Conclusions:
<strong>This trial is among the first to assess the effect of a comprehensive and evidence-informed mHealth app intervention on young adult smoking cessation</strong>. Strengths of the trial include the quality research design, the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, and in-depth assessment of the implementation of the intervention. <strong>If effective, the trial has the potential to demonstrate that including mHealth as a population-based intervention strategy can cost-effectively reach a greater proportion of the population and help young adult smokers quit</strong>.
