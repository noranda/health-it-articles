Assessment is a core function of public health. Comprehensive clinical data may enhance community health assessment by providing up-to-date, representative data for use in public health programs and policies, especially when combined with community-level data relevant to social determinants. In this study <strong>we examine routinely collected and geospatially-enhanced EHR data to assess population health at various levels of geographic granularity available from a regional health information exchange</strong>. We present preliminary findings and discuss <strong>important biases in EHR data</strong>. Future work is needed to develop methods for correcting for those biases to support routine epidemiology work of public health.

Results:
Rates of diabetes ranged from 1.5% to 16.07% with an average of 8.9% among neighborhoods spread across a metropolitan area. When examined at the census tract level, diabetes rates ranged from 1.5% to 12.83% with an average of 8.9% of the population for a given area. <strong>We identified three biases in using EHR data. First, EHR data only represent those that seek health care. Second, linked EHR data are biased based how patient records were matched. The HIE uses a probabilistic technique, which can result in duplicate records. Third, the HIE proportionally contains more data from low income providers</strong>. We are exploring ways to adjust rates and correct these biases so they do not overestimate burden of disease and poor care quality in innercity neighborhoods. We seek to compare census tract, neighborhood, and other geographic area measures with data from a recent population survey.
