Objective:
<strong>To evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based lifestyle health promotion intervention in lowering obesity among adults with diabetes</strong> in two ethnically diverse Chicago area neighborhoods.

Methods: The trial enrolled 331 adults with BMI ≥24 kg/m2and prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.  <strong>Participants were randomized to either: (1) control - brief lifestyle counseling with nearby community resource information; or (2) intervention - encouragement to participate in a group-based adaptation of the LookAHEAD program offered free-of-charge by the YMCA</strong>. The primary outcome was mean difference in body weight at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in HbA1c, cholesterol, and blood pressures. Intent-to-treat analyses used mixed-effects regression models (maximum likelihood estimation) that adjusted for weight at baseline.

Results:
Participants had a mean (SD) age of 57.4 ± 11.4 years, BMI 35.6± 7.6 kg/m2, HbA1c 7.22 ± 1.25%. Approximately half (50.2%) were women, 30.5% were African American, 34.4% were non-Hispanic White, and 27.5% were Hispanic.  Approximately one third (35.3%) reported annual household income of <$25,000. <strong>Compared to controls, participants randomized to the group lifestyle intervention lost an additional 1.29 kg (95% CI 0.47 – 2.14 kg) at 6 months, regardless of intervention attendance</strong>. Differences in mean weight loss were not statistically significant across race/ethnicity. Future analyses will include comparisons at 12 months and 24 months.

Conclusions:
Delivery of a group adaptation of the LookAHEAD program by YMCAs results in a scalable lower cost mechanism to help patients with type 2 diabetes lose weight. <strong>Health care reform models and reimbursement policies should include access to community-based intensive healthy lifestyle interventions to translate interventions into practice</strong>.
