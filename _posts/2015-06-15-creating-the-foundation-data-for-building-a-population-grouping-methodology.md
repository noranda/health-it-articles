Background:
In April 2013, CIHI initiated a project to <strong>develop a population grouping methodology that stratifies a population based on past clinical information and produces risk measures</strong> (i.e., costs for the prospective year). The methodology includes all individuals in the population at a given moment, including those who are not using the health system. The foundation data for this project include historical clinical administrative and utilization data that are linkable at the individual level.

Results:
<strong>Person-level cost information is a combination of actual and imputed patient-level costs</strong>. The foundation data include four Canadian provinces that have sufficient historical clinical and cost data and where a registered persons file could be obtained. The data include six consecutive years of physician claims data, hospital inpatient data, day surgery data, emergency department data, and long-term care assessment data. The health sectors included in the foundation data were chosen based on data coverage considerations as well as the relative contribution that the health sector makes to understanding disease burden in a population.

Conclusions:
<strong>Creating foundation data for the development of a population grouping methodology is a significant undertaking</strong>. This paper focuses on the elements that were important for methodology development. Not discussed in this paper are the technical challenges of manipulating very large databases and standardizing data across databases and over multiple years.
